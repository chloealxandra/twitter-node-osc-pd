MIDI to DMX light control and PD patch: test.pd from this instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/MIDI2DMX/step3/Program-the-Teensy/
This is the open source DMX2MIDI controller I used

The code in main.js uses both of these node modules to trigger a PD Patch using a twitter stream. For different twitter queries (search without stream, location ect, see npm twitter docs). 

I've included a patch which triggers a DMX 7 channel light to turn on and off and (random) change colors with each tweet message. Netrecieve is the port for the OSC code, and sends messages to the PD objects
